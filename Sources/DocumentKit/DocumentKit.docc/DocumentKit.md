## Overview

![Library logotype](Logo.png)

DocumentKit is a Swift SDK that adds more capabilities to `DocumentGroup`-based apps in SwiftUI.

`DocumentGroup`-based apps are in general quite limited when it comes to customization. For instance, you can't add custom items to the document browser toolbar. Also, since a `DocumentGroup` has no view until you open a document, you can't present any initial onboarding screens or modals from it. 

DocumentKit lets you do all these things, to let you create a better user experience for your document-based apps.

# ``DocumentKit``

DocumentKit adds more capabilities to `DocumentGroup`-based apps.


## Overview

![Library logotype](Logo.png)

`DocumentGroup`-based apps are limited when it comes to customization. For instance, you can't add any custom items to the document browser toolbar, and since it has no view until you open a document, you can't present any initial onboarding screens or modals from it. 

DocumentKit lets you do all these things, to let you create a better app experience for your document-based apps.



## Installation

DocumentKit can be installed with the Swift Package Manager:

```
https://github.com/danielsaidi/DocumentKit.git
```

If you prefer to not have external dependencies, you can also just copy the source code into your app.
